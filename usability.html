    <h2>Method</h2>

    <p> The website that I studied was my own. The target audience for this website is for people who would want to see my progress in Web Design. The three tasks that I assigned was to click on links. Click on a different page. Click on pictures.</p>

    <h2>Results</h2>

    <p> The testers were able to complete the tasks. It was a little difficult thought because the screen was cropped down they couldn't see all of the information on the page. It didn't take too long to complete the tasks. Each task was fairly easy.</p>

    <h2>Discussion</h2>

    <p> I learned that making things your way may be easy for you but when someone else uses it, it's not that easy for them to navigate. Yes the current design is effective. If in full screen you can see the information clearly and not get lost. The site can be designed differently by maybe adding different colors or fonts to things so that it pops out more to the user. Also maybe even making things larger.</p>
