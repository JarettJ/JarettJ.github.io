It also includes my reflections (below) is what i learned in each unit and links to each unit in the course.

                  <h2>Unit 2</h2>

                  <p> In Unit 2 i've learned the basics of HTML. With the basic I have also learned that difficulty of making that looks very basic yet hard to do. Probably the most hardest part of Unit 2 was getting the right tags in for each part so that it looks nice and neat. Also there were new things that i've learned. Like how to make a table that is ogranized. There were many hardships from Unit 2 but I am glad that I got to learn them so now I can apply these skills when in the real world.</p>
           



                  <h2>Unit 3</h2>  

                  <p> In Unit 3 I was introduced to the wold of CSS. In the beginning, I had no idea how what CSS was or what it even does and how it relates to HTML. Though after just the basics of CSS, I understood that CSS is what made a webpage look good. There are so many things to do with CSS that really blew my mind. After all of the basics of CSS like color, typography, then came the tricky stuff. The first complicated thing that we learned was The Box Model. Learning about borders and padding is pretty hard but I managed to make something look clean. I have to say that the ID and Class in CSS was hard. Along with moving borders around and getting the things that I wanted in the right place. Im glad that I know CSS because without it, my webpage would look dull.</p>

                  <h2>Unit 4</h2>

                  <p> In Unit 4 we dived into more Wen Graphics and creating and inputting images for our website. We learend how to crop images for a thumbnail and put that into our website. With images, I learned that by creating a thumbnail, you get a preview of what or how that photo is like without seeing all of the details when it's in full size. After we looked on how to create buttons. The buttons were used for our email and images. Then we learned how to insert a webpage banner. With the banner, it's one of the main attentions that people will see when coming to the website; it should be pleasing to the eye. With all of this we also learned the differences between JPGs PNGs and GIFs and which one should be used for certain situations. </p>

                  <h2>Unit 5</h2>

                  <p> In Unit 5 we started to learn how to use JavaScript. The beginning, we learned what Client-side is and how it's different to Server-side scripting. After we learned that, we really got into the basics of javascript. At first, learning how to show an alert was the most basic thing we did. Then we learned some JavasScript errors and what can go wrong. One thing that really stuck out to me is that JavaScript is case sensitive. This is really important when doing JavaScript. The second thing we did was making a clock. This was a challenge to do but after we learned the basics of it, we really got into how to put the right time or how to put military time. Lastly we were showed how to hide content and make buttons for our video. With all of these learend I can now use JavaScript properly. </p>

                  <h2>Unit 6</h2>

                  <p class="temp"> In Unit 6 we really learned more about quality control. The first steps was to validate our website. By doing that we can see how our HTML can be fixed and things that can be improved on. After getting everything validated, including our CSS, we had some testers to test out the quality of our website. We made a survey about things that we can improve on and tasks to do on our website. We then learned how to create a proper survey for future reference. Without learning how to validate, some code on our screen make look good but on another screen it may look different.</p>

                  <h2>Unit 7</h2>

                  <p class="temp">This section will be completed soon</p>
